            <h3>A.I. Helper buddy</h3>
            <p>Upon registration, users fill out a form asking simple questions about their
                background, visa status, and needed information. With this data, the MyBuddy app
                generates a personalized, A.I-driven virtual companion that provides users with the
                exact information they need for their stay in Munich. With the help of a keyword
                feature, users can easily select or enter keywords to inform their buddy on the needed
                information: By utilizing these keywords and the user profile, the virtual buddy
                promptly retrieves essential information from government websites and offers users a
                personalized, simplified guide tailored to their preferred language and literacy level.
                <br>
                Apart from questions regarding comprehensive newcomer data, users can also pose
                various other inquiries to their Buddy concerning their Munich stay, such as "Where is
                the nearest Aldi?" or "How do I reach Maximilianstrasse?" - similar to a personal guide
                and friend, The AI Buddy adeptly supplies all requisite information to users,within
                seconds. </p>
                <br>
                <p><em>Disclaimer: the AI buddy will not engage in any personal conversation with the user
                    and only answer factual questions about the city of Munich – thus ensuring that the
                    MyBuddy AI buddy does not in any way become a replacement for human interaction. </em></p>

                <h3>Buddy-to-Buddy connections </h3>
                <p>An algorithm groups users with similar backgrounds or requirements and suggests
                    them to each other, encouraging them to connect. When users pose questions to their
                    buddy, they have the option to share these inquiries with their connected buddies, who
                    may share a similar circumstance or have undergone comparable procedures. Rather
                    than solely relying on administrative personnel to address inquiries, users can initially
                    consult others in analogous situations and exchange city-related information, fostering
                    a cooperative environment among like-minded users. Should users still desire to
                    speak to an official city representative to address their inquiries, they can request to
                    share their questions with admin staff profiles. These staff members can then respond
                    to their queries through a chatbox and offer personalized, one-to-one assistance. 
                </p>

                <p><em>Disclaimer: The users personal buddy will filter out any misleading information or
                    potential spam. Users can only chat about information regarding their stay in Munich:
                    any personal chats will be removed immediately. </em></p>
