            <h3>A.I. Helper buddy</h3>
            <p>Upon registration, users fill out a form asking simple questions about their
                background, visa status, and needed information. With this data, the MyBuddy app
                generates a personalized, A.I-driven virtual companion that provides users with the
                exact information they need for their stay in Munich. With the help of a keyword
                feature, users can easily select or enter keywords to inform their buddy on the needed
                information: By utilizing these keywords and the user profile, the virtual buddy
                promptly retrieves essential information from government websites and offers users a
                personalized, simplified guide tailored to their preferred language and literacy level.
                <br>
                Apart from questions regarding comprehensive newcomer data, users can also pose
                various other inquiries to their Buddy concerning their Munich stay, such as "Where is
                the nearest Aldi?" or "How do I reach Maximilianstrasse?" - similar to a personal guide
                and friend, The AI Buddy adeptly supplies all requisite information to users,within
                seconds. </p>
                <br>
                <p><em>Disclaimer: the AI buddy will not engage in any personal conversation with the user
                    and only answer factual questions about the city of Munich – thus ensuring that the
                    MyBuddy AI buddy does not in any way become a replacement for human interaction. </em></p>
            </div>

            <!-- PARAGRAPH 2: WELCOME CHECKLIST -->
            <div class="P1">
                <h3>Welcome Checklist</h3>
                <p>Once the buddy is generated, users can select specific goals for their time in Munich,
                    such as "Applying for a resident visa" or "Exploring work options". Based on this input,
                    the buddy creates a personalized checklist for the user, offering clear guidance for
                    each objective
                </p>

                <p>Within each checkpoint, users can access a comprehensive FAQ section and reach out
                    to their buddy for assistance whenever needed. Should users still require further
                    support, they have the option to submit their query to an appropriate government
                    representative office and schedule a call. Representatives can review users' concerns
                    in advance, ensuring requests are directed to the correct department and enabling
                    them to prepare beforehand. Ultimately, this fosters efficient, personalized support for
                    each newcomer
                </p>

                <p>As users progress through their checklist, they earn rewards for completing tasks
                    such as upgrading their buddy with additional features or receiving discounts from our
                    partner businesses in Munich, including local supermarkets and shops. This strategy
                    provides mutual advantages: On one hand, it boosts user engagement, turning the
                    newcomer journey into an enjoyable and interactive experience rather than a tedious
                    one. On the other, it enables MyBuddy to partner with local businesses keen on
                    presenting their offerings to newcomers, thereby generating essential revenue.
                </p>

                    potential spam. Users can only chat about information regarding their stay in Munich:

                <h3>The Map Feature</h3>
                <p>Currently, the primary focus of the MyBuddy app is to offer users personalized
                    information through their virtual buddy and checklist. However, in the future, additional
                    features can be incorporated to acquaint users with their immediate surroundings and
                    assist them in other aspects, for example in finding jobs that match their specific
                    qualifications.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>One such feature could be the "Map Feature." This feature provides a comprehensive
                map of Munich, displaying all street names and the user's real-time location. It also
                includes pop-up icon recommendations for restaurants, hotels, shops, and cultural
                sites, which can be tailored to the user's cultural preferences and budget. Additionally,
                users can explore businesses nearby that offer jobs aligned with their qualifications
                and job preferences. When users express interest in a job, they are directed to the
                corresponding application form on the business' website. This feature would offer new
                residents a convenient map overview of key locations in the city and relevant
                information about nearby opportunities.</p>
